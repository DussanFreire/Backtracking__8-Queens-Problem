# Backtracking - 8 Queens Problem ‚ôõ

##  Overview

The 8 Queens Problem is a classic backtracking problem where the goal is to place 8 queens on an 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This project implements a console application in C# that allows users to explore different configurations of queens on the board.

Backtracking is a problem-solving technique used in computer science and mathematics for finding solutions to constraint satisfaction problems. It involves incrementally building candidates to a solution and abandoning (backtracking) those candidates as soon as it is determined that they cannot lead to a valid solution.

### Key Characteristics of Backtracking:

1.	Incremental Approach: Backtracking builds candidates for the solution step by step. Each candidate is a partial solution that could potentially lead to a complete solution.
2.	Constraints: The method applies constraints to determine if the current candidate can still lead to a valid solution. If a constraint is violated, the algorithm backtracks to the previous step and tries the next candidate.
3.	Recursive Nature: Backtracking is often implemented using recursion. The function calls itself to explore different possibilities, and if it reaches a dead end, it returns to the previous state (backtracks).
4.	Exploration of All Possible Solutions: It explores all possible configurations for a problem, which is why it‚Äôs particularly useful for problems like puzzles, games, and optimization problems.

### Example: The 8 Queens Problem

In the 8 Queens problem, backtracking is used to place queens on a chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. Here‚Äôs how backtracking is applied:

1.	Place a Queen: Start placing queens in the first row, trying different columns.
2.	Check Validity: For each placement, check if it‚Äôs valid (i.e., no other queen can attack it).
3.	Recursion: If the placement is valid, recursively try to place the next queen in the next row.
4.	Backtrack: If placing a queen leads to an invalid state later on, backtrack by removing the last placed queen and try the next column.
5.	Solution Found: Continue this process until all queens are placed or all possibilities have been exhausted.

### Advantages of Backtracking:

*	Simplicity: It‚Äôs relatively simple to understand and implement, especially for problems that require exploring combinations or permutations.
*	Flexibility: It can be applied to a wide range of problems, such as pathfinding, puzzles, and combinatorial optimization.
